# D-D-UAMystic-Discipline-Talent-Card-Generator
A python program that takes in a .csv from 5e.tools-with one or two small fixes to errors in their data entry, specifically two places where spaces are either not present or are present where they shouldn't be-and turns them into reference cards that can be printed and used for whatever you might want to use them for.
